**Blood and Pain**

- Injuries cause bleeding three times more.

- Injuries cause twice more pain and thrice for non-bleeding injuries(ex, bruises).

- Blood loss causes pain and more severe conscious lose.

- Punctured organs now cause three times severe bleeding. (In vanilla, punctured kidney, lungs and liver etc doesn't cause additional blood loss, only heart and neck does.)

- Go Juice pain reduction increased to 80% from 10%, and now increase blood filtration and blood pumping.
